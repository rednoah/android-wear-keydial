# Pilot Study

Evaluate 3 KeyDial and 2 SwipeKey keyboard layouts.


## Procedure

### Phase 1: Keyboard Selection
Select the `KeyDial` on your Android Wear watch. After opening the keyboard, feel free to play with it until you understand how it works. Once you're ready, type `START` and hit `⏎`.

### Phase 2: Character Training
Follow the prompt and enter the given characters one by one **as rapidly as possible**. Do not worry about accuracy during this training phase. Focus on memorizing where each key is located. You can skip to the next phase by hitting `⏎`.

### Phase 3: Phrase Input
Follow the prompt and enter the given phrases **as quickly and as accurately** as possible. Feel free to correct mistakes when it's easy and ignore them when it's too troublesome. There will be a total of `5` phrases. You can take a rest before typing the first letter of each phrase. The count for each phrase starts when the first letter is entered. Please press `⏎` after entering each phrase.

* Press the left-hand side of the input text field to delete (`⌫`) the last character
* Press the right-hand side of the input text field to add a space (`⌴`) at the end
* All input is considered `case-insensitive`


### Final Step
Once you have completed each task for each keyboard, please fill out the [Pilot Study Questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/h5IpYRM28MMJ5ozq2).




# Main Study

Evaluate 3 keyboard layouts (`KeyDial`, `SwipeKey` and `Standard QWERTY`) on phrase input (i.e. natural language) and out-of-vocabulary input (i.e. passwords).

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Keyboard Selection
Select the `KeyDial (Phrase Input)` on your Android Wear watch. After opening the keyboard, feel free to play with it until you understand how it works. Once you're ready, type `START` and hit `⏎`.

### Phase 2: Character Training
Follow the prompt and enter the given characters one by one **as rapidly as possible**. Do not worry about accuracy during this training phase. Focus on memorizing where each key is located. **DO NOT** press `⏎` until instructed to do so by the prompter.

### Phase 3: Phrase Input
Follow the prompt and enter the given phrases **as quickly and as accurately** as possible. Feel free to correct mistakes when it's easy and ignore them when it's too troublesome. There will be a total of `20` phrases for each of the `3` keyboards. You can take a rest before typing the first letter of each phrase. The count for each phrase starts when the first letter is entered. Press `⏎` to submit your input and to continue to the next phrase.

* Press the left-hand side of the input text field to delete (`⌫`) the last character
* Press the right-hand side of the input text field to add a space (`⌴`) at the end
* All input is considered `case-insensitive`

### Phase 4: Password Input
Select the `KeyDial (OOV)` on your Android Wear watch. Your final task will be to enter `5` passwords with each of the `3` keyboards. Please note that password input is `case-sensitive` and must be entered exactly (including upper-case and lower-case letters).
