our silver anniversary is coming
the objective of the exercise
coalition governments never work
my favourite sport is racketball
file all complaints in writing
life is but a dream
the protesters blocked all traffic
that referendum asked a silly question
rectangular objects have four sides
the treasurer must balance her books
the opposing team is over there
universities are too expensive
knee bone is connected to the thigh bone
learn to walk before you run
do not drink the water
your presentation was inspiring
a thoroughly disgusting thing to say
weeping willows are found near water
my fingers are very cold
consequences of a wrong turn
the minimum amount of time
bring the offenders to justice
come and see our new car
the cat has a pleasant temperament
get your priorities in order
goldilocks and the three bears
do you get nervous when you speak
can I skate with sister today
the accident scene is a shrine for fans
we are having spaghetti
a feeling of complete exasperation
microscopes make small things look big
gamblers eventually loose their shirts
my bike has a flat tire
zero in on the facts
an offer you cannot refuse
an excellent way to communicate
please keep this confidential
quit while you are ahead
labour unions know how to organize
my bare face in the wind
do not worry about this
what a lovely red jacket
the acceptance speech was boring
my mother makes good cookies
earth quakes are predictable
join us on the patio
very reluctant to enter
we went grocery shopping
reading week is just about here
saving that child was an heroic effort
universally understood to be wrong
the punishment should fit the crime
every apple from every tree
call for more details
be persistent to win a strike
the presidential suite is very busy
win first prize in the contest
please provide your date of birth
there are winners and losers
